# HighSchoolDimuonDemo

This is a collection of simple demo codes prepared for high school students. It is based on the CMS open data released at 
https://opendata.cern.ch/record/5201

The first 2 demo codes (demo01 and demo02) use plain python language (no array tools, etc) to read the CSV file and produce a straightforward confirmation of special relativity enegy-momentum formula.

The later two codes (demo03 and demo04) are based on the first 2 demo codes, but use matplotlib package to produce histograms. The demo03 simply shows the energy distributions for one of the muons in each event; demo04 shows the invariant mass distributions, which can be used to "rediscover" those well-known particles in the history of particle physics.
